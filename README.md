### üß† ABOUT

miniML is a deep-learning-based tool to detect synaptic events in 1d time-series data. It uses a CNN-LSTM network architecture that was trained using a large dataset of synaptic events (miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents) from cerebellar mossy fiber to granule cell synapses. 

In this repository, we provide pre-trained models and Python code to run model inference on recorded data. In addition, documentation and an application example (cerebellar granule cell recording) are included.


### üì¢ UPDATES

#### 8 January 2024
We have updated the documentation for miniML. The latest version of the documentation is available [here](https://delvendahl.github.io/miniML/intro.html).

Please also see the updated preprint at [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.11.02.565316v3).


### üíª INSTALLATION

To use miniML, clone the GitHub Repository and install the requirements. The Python dependencies are: sklearn, matplotlib, h5py, pandas, numpy, scipy, tensorflow, pyabf. To install all dependencies using pip, run the following command in your Python environment:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

miniML can be run on a GPU to speed model inference. Either CUDA or tensorflow-metal are required for GPU use. Installation instructions for these requirements may depend on the specific hardware and OS and can be found online.

The release of TensorFlow 2.16 and Keras 3 introduced breaking changes that raise an error when loading models trained with earlier TensorFlow versions. To avoid this, it is recommended to use TensorFlow 2.14 or 2.15.

To use miniML with a graphical user interface (GUI), you need to install the additional dependencies from the requirements_gui.txt file.  


### ‚è± RUNNING MINIML

#### Analysis workflow in Python
First, a miniML *MiniTrace* object needs to be created containing 1d timeseries data. Currently, miniML supports direct loading from HEKA .dat files, Axon .abf files as well as HDF .h5 files. The *Trace* object features discrete methods for loading from these file formats (e.g., **MiniTrace.from_h5_file()**). Data in other file formats need to be imported as Python objects.

Next, a miniML *EventDetection* object is initiated. Here, one needs to specify a miniML model file to use as well as the *Trace* object to operate on. 

miniML model inference can then be run using the **detect_events()** method. This method will run miniML over the given data using the specified model. Runtime will depend on data length. 

Following event detection, the individual detected events are analyzed and descriptive statistics are calculated for the recording.

miniML includes several plotting methods. They can be found in the miniML_plots class in miniML_plot_functions.py. A detection object has to be passed as data argument. 

Event data and statistics can be saved in different formats (.pickle, .h5, .csv).

#### Analysis workflow via GUI

miniML can also be used via a GUI. To use the GUI, execute the miniml_gui.py file (located in the "core/" folder). The GUI allows easy loading of data, pre-processing (filtering, detrending etc.) and model inference. Found events can be inspecte and deleted, if desired. The GUI can also be used to save results to a CSV or HDF5 file.


### üí° EXAMPLE

The folder "example_data/" contains an example recording from a cerebellar mossy fiber to granule cell synapse. To use miniML on this data, run the commented example Jupyter Notebook ([tutorial](docs/general/tutorial.ipynb)) illustrating the use of miniML.
